    "Iris is perhaps the best known dataset which originated from a 1936 research paper by a British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. The dataset is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations e.g. Scatter Plot. Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its 3 types of species and measurements of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.\n",
